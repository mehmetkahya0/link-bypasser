1. **Service-Specific Handlers**: Custom logic for major shortening services
2. **HTML Content Analysis**: Advanced parsing of redirect pages and meta tags  
3. **HTTP Redirect Following**: Intelligent redirect chain resolution
4. **CORS Proxy Integration**: Secure fallback methods for challenging cases

## Usage Guide

### Basic Operation
1. Navigate to the application in your web browser
2. Enter any shortened URL in the input field
3. Click "Bypass Link" or press Enter to process
4. Receive the direct URL with options to copy or open in new tab

### Advanced Features
- **Batch Processing**: Sequential processing of multiple URLs
- **Link Validation**: Real-time URL format verification
- **Copy Integration**: One-click clipboard functionality
- **Mobile PWA**: Install as progressive web app on mobile devices

## API Reference

### Core Classes

```javascript
// Primary bypass functionality
class LinkBypassPro {
    async bypassUrl(url)           // Main bypass method
    extractFromShortener(html, url) // Service-specific extraction
    followRedirects(url)           // HTTP redirect following
    parseHtmlForRedirect(html)     // HTML content analysis
}

// Utility functions
class LinkBypassUtils {
    static isValidUrl(string)      // URL validation
    static extractDomain(url)      // Domain extraction
    static isShortener(url, domains) // Shortener detection
    static normalizeUrl(url)       // URL normalization
}
```

### Configuration Options

```javascript
// Timeout settings (milliseconds)
const CONFIG = {
    GLOBAL_TIMEOUT: 15000,         // Maximum processing time
    METHOD_TIMEOUT: 8000,          // Individual method timeout
    FETCH_TIMEOUT: 5000           // Network request timeout
};
```

## Development Guide

### Adding New Service Support

To integrate a new URL shortening service:

1. **Add Domain Recognition**
```javascript
// In getSupportedDomains()
'newservice.com',
'ns.co',
```

2. **Create Service Handler**
```javascript
// In LinkBypassPro class
handleNewService(html, originalUrl) {
    // Custom extraction logic
    const match = html.match(/redirect-url["']?\s*:\s*["']([^"']+)/);
    return match ? match[1] : null;
}
```

3. **Register Handler**
```javascript
// In extractFromShortener()
case 'newservice.com':
    return this.handleNewService(html, originalUrl);
```

### Testing Framework

Generate test links using the included Python script:

```bash
python3 generate_links.py
```

This creates real working shortened links from various services for comprehensive testing.
